    age_incidence(postProcessor::PostProcessor, timespan::Int64, basesize::Int64)
    age_incidence(postProcessor::PostProcessor; timespan::Int64 = 7, basesize::Int64 = 100_000)

Returns a `DataFrame` containing the infection incidence stratified by (10-year) age groups.
The `timespan` parameter defines a time window in ticks and the `basesize` parameter
defines the reference population size to calculate incidences.
Assuming 1 tick to be 1 day, a `timespan = 7` and `basesize = 100_000` configuration results
in the commonly known seven-day incidence per 100,000.

The structure assumes no individuals exceeding the age of 100.

# Parameters

- `postProcessor::PostProcessor`: Post processor instance
- `timespan::Int64`: Reference time window to calculate incidence
- `basesize::Int64`: Reference population size to calculate incidence

# Returns

- `DataFrame` with the following columns:
