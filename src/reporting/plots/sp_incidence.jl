### PLOT GENERATION
###

"""
    generate(plt::Incidence, rd::ResultData; plotargs...)

Generates an age-stratified incidence plot.
You can pass any additional keyword arguments using `plotargs...` that are available in the `Plots.jl` package.

# Parameters

- `plt::Incidence`: `SimulationPlot` struct with meta data (i.e. title, description, and filename)
- `rd::ResultData`: Input data used to generate plot
- `plotargs...` *(optional)*: Any argument that the `plot()` function of the `Plots.jl` package can take.

# Returns

- `Plots.Plot`: Incidence plot
