File 0_Helpers Content:
File 0 is one of the most technical, files there. Here is a recap of the functions and structs
    inside it. The other chapters will be more descriptive.

0.1 Numeric distribution helpers functions
0.2 Age group helpers
0.3 Event configuration model

0.1 Numeric distribution helpers functions:
function negbin_params -> gives the parameters needed for a negative binomial distribution,
    starting from variance and mean.
function sample_n_contacts -> draws the number of contacts following a negative binomial
    distribution if possible, poisson if not.
function gamma_params ->convert the transmission values given by the user into parameters used by
    Julia

0.2 Age group helpers:
age_group:idx -> classifies age into groups
function age_group_label_from_idx -> format age groups into labels
age_grroup_label -> combines the two

0.3 Event configration model
struct Section -> lowest level of events. Represent different sides, behaviours or composition
    of the same event.
    NOTE: there is no cross infections between sections
struct Event -> one gathering, produced by sample_events() (3_Population) not user constructed
struct Category -> Represent a type of events from where a n_draws number of events are picked.
    It contains the data from where to generate the events.
    NOTE: If the number of draws is set to 1, a category can be used to represent a specific  event.
    NOTE: Further explanation on the fields will be given in section 1_Userconfig
struct EventConfig -> keeps all categories/events togheter. It has age and sex distribution
    that works as fallback if they are missing from the category

0.4 Config Validation
function validate_config -> checks that the values given are of the right lenght, bounded and
    ordered in the correct ways to prevent errors.

0.5 Result types and aggregation
const EventCounts -> constant to store the SEIR number of each event
const EventStat -> constant to store statistics about each event
function analyze_event_population ->
