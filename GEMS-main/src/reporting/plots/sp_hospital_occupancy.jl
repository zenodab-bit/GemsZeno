### PLOT GENERATION

"""
    generate(plt::HospitalOccupancy, rd::ResultData; plotargs...)

Generates a plot of the number of hospitalized, ventilated and ICU admitted agents for each tick.
You can pass any additional keyword arguments using `plotargs...` that are available in the `Plots.jl` package.

# Parameters

- `plt::HospitalOccupancy`: `SimulationPlot` struct with meta data (i.e. title, description, and filename)
- `rd::ResultData`: Input data used to generate plot
- `plotargs...` *(optional)*: Any argument that the `plot()` function of the `Plots.jl` package can take.

# Returns

- `Plots.Plot`: Hospital Occupancy plot
