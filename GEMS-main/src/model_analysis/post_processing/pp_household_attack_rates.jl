    household_attack_rates(postProcessor::PostProcessor; hh_samples::Int64 = HOUSEHOLD_ATTACK_RATE_SAMPLES)

Returns a `DataFrame` containing data on the in-household attack rate.
The in-household attack rate is defined as the fraction of individuals
in a given household that got infected within the household
(in-household infection chain) caused by the *first* introduction of 
the pathogen in this household. It does *not* reflect *overall*
fraction of individuals that were infected in this household throughout
the course of the simuation. As the attack rate calculation is very 
computationally intensive, it is not done for _all_ household but rather 
for a subset of households. You can change the desired subset size
through the optional `hh_samples` argument. Its default can be found
in `constants.jl`

# Returns

- `DataFrame` with the following columns:

| :------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `first_introduction` | `Int16`   | Time of when the first member of the respective household was exposed |
| `hh_id`              | `Int32`   | Household setting identifier                                          |

| `chain_size`         | `Int32`   | Number of individuals that got infected within the household          |
| `hh_attack_rate`     | `Float64` | Number of infected individuals divided by household size              |
