export detected_tick_cases

"""
    detected_tick_cases(postProcessor::PostProcessor)

Returns the number of detected cases per tick and the number of true new exposures.
This analysis is based on the `tick_test` column of the infections-dataframe 
which indicates when an individual with an active infection was first tested positive.
Thus, there might be a delay between `exposure_cnt` and `detected_cnt`.

# Returns

- `DataFrame` with the following columns:

| Name                   | Type    | Description                                                           |
| :--------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tick`                 | `Int16` | Simulation tick (time)                                                |
| `total_reported_cases` | `Int64` | Total number of reported cases at that tick                           |
| `new_detections`       | `Int64` | Number of true new detected cases at that tick (not known before)     |
| `double_reports`       | `Int64` | Number of cases that were reported at that tick but were known before |
| `false_positives`      | `Int64` | Number of false positive reports at that tick                         |
| `exposed_cnt`          | `Int64` | Number of new infections at that tick                                 |
